# Example Results Images

This directory contains example visualization outputs demonstrating the Tank Armor Penetration Simulator's capabilities.

## Included Examples

### `penetration_L31A7_HESH_RHA_200.0mm.png`
**L31A7 HESH vs 200mm RHA at 60° Impact Angle**

Demonstrates the 4-panel penetration analysis:
- **Panel 1**: Angle of attack geometry showing steep 60° impact against sloped armor
- **Panel 2**: HESH spalling mechanism with plastic explosive spread and spall cone effects
- **Panel 3**: Behind-armor effects showing spall fragment damage to crew compartment
- **Panel 4**: Summary statistics showing successful penetration with 168.8mm overmatch

Key Physics: HESH effectiveness against homogeneous steel through spalling rather than direct penetration.

### `trajectory_M829A4_APFSDS_100.0m.png` 
**M829A4 APFSDS Ballistic Trajectory at 100m Range**

Demonstrates ballistic trajectory visualization:
- **Upper Panel**: Flight path showing minimal ballistic arc at short range with impact angle annotation
- **Lower Panel**: Velocity decay from 1680 m/s muzzle velocity to ~1670 m/s impact velocity
- **Target**: 100mm RHA representation with armor geometry

Key Physics: Minimal trajectory drop and velocity loss for high-velocity kinetic rounds at close range.

## Educational Value

These examples showcase:
- **Different ammunition mechanisms**: Kinetic penetration vs spalling effects
- **Range effects**: Short-range ballistics vs medium-range engagements  
- **Armor interaction**: How different armor types respond to various threats
- **Professional visualization**: Technical diagram quality suitable for analysis

## Usage

These files serve as:
- **Reference examples** for expected output quality
- **Educational materials** for understanding armor penetration physics
- **Documentation samples** for the visualization system capabilities
